# Lovable Platform Development Notice

## Original Development Platform

The CMA Neural OS system was originally created and crafted on the **Lovable platform** (lovable.dev), which provided an excellent environment for rapid prototyping and iterative development of this decentralized operating system.

## Current Platform Limitations

Due to ongoing synchronization issues between GitHub and Lovable, this repository may not be fully compatible with the Lovable platform at this time. These syncing bugs present significant risks to the development progress of the system.

### Identified Issues

1. **Bidirectional Sync Problems**: Changes made in either platform may not properly synchronize
2. **File Integrity Risks**: WASM files and complex system components may not transfer correctly
3. **Development Progress Protection**: To safeguard months of development work, we recommend avoiding Lovable sync until these issues are resolved

## Recommended Development Approach

For continued development of the CMA Neural OS:

- **Primary Development**: Use traditional Git workflows with GitHub as the source of truth
- **IDE Compatibility**: The codebase is fully compatible with VS Code, WebStorm, and other modern IDEs
- **Local Development**: All components can be developed locally using standard React/TypeScript toolchains
- **Platform Agnostic**: The system architecture remains independent of any specific development platform

## Future Platform Compatibility

Once the Lovable-GitHub synchronization issues are resolved, this repository can be safely imported back into the Lovable platform for continued visual development.

## Contact

For questions about platform compatibility or development setup, please refer to our global deployment documentation or community channels listed in the README.
