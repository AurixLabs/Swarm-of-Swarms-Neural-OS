## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method: Email
Send security reports to: **security@goodymorgan.dev**

Include:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We'll keep you informed of progress weekly
4. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 90 days

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### AI Model Security
- **Model Integrity**: All AI models are cryptographically verified
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all AI inputs and outputs
- **Isolation**: AI kernels run in isolated environments
- **Ethics Verification**: All AI operations undergo ethics framework validation

### Kernel Communication Security
- **Event Validation**: All inter-kernel events are validated and sanitized
- **Access Control**: Kernels have defined permission boundaries
- **Audit Logging**: All kernel communications are logged for security analysis
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data in kernel communication is encrypted

### WASM Security
- **Sandboxing**: WASM modules run in secure sandboxes
- **Resource Limits**: Strict memory and CPU limits enforced
- **Capability Control**: Limited access to system resources
- **Code Verification**: WASM modules undergo integrity checks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted when stored
- **Encryption in Transit**: All network communications encrypted
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored
- **Retention Policies**: Clear data retention and deletion policies

## 🔍 Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security
- Always validate and sanitize inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use secure coding practices for the language/framework

### Dependency Security
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review third-party code before inclusion

### AI Model Security
- Validate all model inputs and outputs
- Implement rate limiting for AI operations
- Use secure model storage and loading
- Implement proper model versioning and rollback

### Ethics Framework Compliance
- All AI operations must pass ethics verification
- Implement bias detection and mitigation
- Ensure transparency in AI decision-making
- Maintain audit trails for AI behavior

## 🚀 Security Features

### Built-in Security
- **Robust Ethics Framework**: Cryptographically verified ethical constraints
- **Kernel Isolation**: Each kernel runs in its own security context
- **Event Validation**: All inter-kernel communication is validated
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all system operations

### Monitoring & Detection
- **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered detection of unusual system behavior
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring for security-related performance issues
- **Error Analysis**: Automated analysis of errors for security implications
- **Health Checks**: Regular security health assessments
