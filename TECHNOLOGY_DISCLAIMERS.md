# Technology Performance Disclaimers

## Performance Claims Disclaimer

All performance claims made in this documentation are:

- **Theoretical**: Based on design specifications and may not reflect real-world performance
- **Environment-Dependent**: Actual performance varies significantly based on hardware, network conditions, and usage patterns
- **Comparative**: Comparisons to other technologies are based on publicly available information and may be incomplete
- **Preliminary**: Performance metrics are subject to change as development continues

### Specific Performance Disclaimers

1. **WASM Performance Claims**
   - "Near-native speed" refers to performance relative to interpreted JavaScript, not native compiled code
   - Performance varies significantly across different browsers and devices
   - Memory usage and execution speed depend on the complexity of operations

2. **AI Processing Claims**
   - AI processing speeds depend on model complexity, hardware capabilities, and available memory
   - "Real-time" processing may introduce latency depending on system load
   - Inference times are estimates and may vary significantly in production environments

3. **System Architecture Claims**
   - Scalability claims are based on theoretical architecture design
   - Actual performance under load may differ from specifications
   - Network latency and bandwidth significantly impact distributed processing performance

## Security Disclaimers

### General Security Notice

- **No Absolute Security**: No software system is completely secure
- **Continuous Updates Required**: Security requires ongoing maintenance and updates
- **User Responsibility**: Users must implement appropriate security measures for their specific use cases
- **Threat Landscape Changes**: New vulnerabilities may be discovered over time

### Specific Security Disclaimers

1. **Cryptographic Protections**
   - Cryptographic security depends on proper implementation and key management
   - Protection levels may vary based on the specific cryptographic algorithms used
   - Security effectiveness depends on the overall system configuration

2. **Ethics System Security**
   - Ethical constraints have strong protections but may not prevent all possible bypasses
   - Security depends on proper system configuration and monitoring
   - Regular audits and updates are required to maintain security effectiveness

## Experimental Technology Disclaimer

**ALPHA SOFTWARE**: This system is experimental and under active development. Users should expect:

- **Frequent Changes**: Core functionality may change without notice
- **Potential Instabilities**: System behavior may be unpredictable in some scenarios
- **Limited Testing**: Not all features have been thoroughly tested in production environments
- **Breaking Changes**: Updates may require significant configuration changes

## No Warranties or Guarantees

This software is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, including but not limited to:

- Performance characteristics
- Security effectiveness
- Compatibility with other systems
- Fitness for any particular purpose
- Availability or uptime
- Data integrity or recovery

## Competitive Comparisons Disclaimer

All comparisons to competitive technologies are:

- Based on publicly available information that may be incomplete or outdated
- Subject to interpretation and may not reflect all use cases
- Provided for general informational purposes only
- Not intended as comprehensive competitive analysis

Users should conduct their own evaluation and comparison based on their specific requirements.
