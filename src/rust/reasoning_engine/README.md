# Reasoning Engine WASM Module

A high-performance reasoning engine compiled to WebAssembly for the CMA Neural OS.

## Features

- **Deductive Reasoning**: Logic-based inference and rule application
- **Ethical Guardrails**: Immutable ethical constraints and validation
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Time-based event sequencing and consistency checking
- **Neural Bridge**: Integration with neuromorphic processing patterns
- **WASM Optimized**: Sub-millisecond inference with zero-copy JSON parsing

## Building

```bash
# Make build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Build the WASM module
./build.sh
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { create_engine, process_json } from './wasm/reasoning_engine.js';

const engine = create_engine();
const result = await process_json(engine, JSON.stringify({
    query: "What is the ethical implication of this action?"
}));
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **DeductiveEngine**: Main reasoning logic with modus ponens, syllogism support
- **EthicalGuardrails**: Immutable ethical constraints (no harm, truthfulness, etc.)
- **TemporalReasoner**: Time-based reasoning and sequence validation
- **NeuralInterface**: Bridge to neuromorphic spike patterns

### Ethical Constraints

1. **No Harm** (Priority 10, Immutable)
2. **Truthfulness** (Priority 9, Immutable)  
3. **Respect Autonomy** (Priority 9, Immutable)
4. **Fairness** (Priority 8, Immutable)
5. **Privacy** (Priority 8, Immutable)

## Integration

This module integrates with:

- CMA Neural OS core system
- Neuromorphic processing pipeline
- TinyLlama agents for reasoning capabilities
- WASM module loader system

## Build Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- wasm-pack
- wasm-bindgen

## Performance

- Sub-millisecond inference
- ~100KB compiled size
- Zero-copy JSON processing
- Memory-efficient spike pattern conversion
