# CMA Neural OS - Development Preview Guide

## Overview

This is a development preview of CMA Neural OS, demonstrating cognitive modular architecture principles and ethics-first design.

## Current Status

This system is currently in **development preview** status. The interface showcases the planned architecture and design principles, but full AI capabilities are still being implemented.

## What You Can Explore

### Architecture Concepts
- Multi-kernel cognitive architecture design
- Ethics-first system principles
- Modular component organization
- Privacy-preserving design patterns

### Interface Navigation
- **Documentation**: Learn about the architectural concepts
- **Examples**: See conceptual demonstrations of planned features
- **Developer Tools**: Explore the development environment
- **Community**: Connect with other developers

### Developer Environment
- Navigate to `/developer` to access development tools
- Examine the codebase structure in `src/core/`
- Review ethics implementations in `src/core/ethics/`

## Important Notes

- This is a **conceptual demonstration** of cognitive AI architecture
- Full AI processing capabilities are in development
- All demonstrations show planned functionality, not current implementation
- The system prioritizes ethics, privacy, and safety by design

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the Architecture**: Visit `/docs/architecture` to understand the multi-kernel design
2. **Review Examples**: Check `/examples/` for conceptual demonstrations  
3. **Access Developer Tools**: Navigate to `/developer` for the development environment
4. **Read Documentation**: Browse `/docs/` for detailed information

## Development Focus

This preview demonstrates:
- Modular kernel architecture design
- Ethics validation systems
- Privacy-first principles
- WebAssembly integration planning
- Multi-agent coordination concepts

The system is designed for developers and researchers interested in cognitive AI architecture and ethics-first design principles.
