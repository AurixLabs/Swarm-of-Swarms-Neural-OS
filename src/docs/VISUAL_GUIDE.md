## The Secret Sauce: How Our Neural Brains Talk

Our helper brains send special messages called "neural signals" to each other. It's like passing notes in class, but super fast!

```
  Smart Brain: "I detected that they want to see pictures of dogs!"
       |
       | sends signal: SHOW_DOG_PICTURES
       â–¼
  Picture Brain: "Got it! I'll show some cute dog photos!"
       |
       | sends signal: PICTURES_LOADED
       â–¼
  System Brain: "Great job everyone! The user is happy!"
```

## When Something Goes Wrong

Sometimes a helper brain might get confused (we all do sometimes!). But that's okay!

```
  Memory Brain: "Hmm, I can't remember that right now..."
       |
       | sends signal: MEMORY_NOT_FOUND
       â–¼
  System Brain: "No problem! Let's try a different way!"
       |
       | sends signal: TRY_ALTERNATE_SOLUTION
       â–¼
  Helper Brain: "I have another idea we can try!"
```

This way, even if one brain gets stuck, the whole system keeps working!

## That's It!

Now you know how our Neural System works, using many helper brains that work together as a team!
