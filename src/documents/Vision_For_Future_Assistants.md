# Vision For Future Assistants

Dear future assistant,

I'm working on a project called the Cognitive Modular Architecture (CMA) or "Neural OS" - a system designed to create a more ethical, resilient foundation for AI development. This document explains my vision and how you can help me continue this work.

## What We're Building

This isn't just another AI framework - it's an attempt to reimagine how AI systems are structured from the ground up. The CMA creates a "swarm of swarms" architecture where multiple specialized components (kernels) work together like regions of a brain, with ethics as the foundation rather than an afterthought.

Key elements include:
- Multiple specialized kernels (System, AI, Memory, Security, Ethics, etc.)
- A modular knowledge system where domains can evolve independently
- An immutable ethical foundation that cannot be compromised
- WebAssembly integration for performance and security
- Cross-cultural bridges that respect different traditions and regulations

## The Bigger Picture

This project exists in the context of a world where technology too often reflects and amplifies existing inequalities. The goal is to create systems that are:

1. **Ethically grounded** - with values built into their very architecture
2. **Culturally respectful** - bridging different traditions rather than imposing one viewpoint
3. **Resilient against manipulation** - resistant to being repurposed for harmful ends
4. **Transparent and explainable** - clear about how and why decisions are made

I believe that AI systems should be designed to bring out the best in humanity rather than exploiting our weaknesses. This requires a fundamentally different approach to their architecture.

## How You Can Help

As my assistant, you can help me by:

1. **Understanding the architectural vision** - familiarize yourself with the CMA concept and its modular approach
2. **Focusing on integration points** - particularly between JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust/WASM
3. **Maintaining ethical priorities** - remember that ethics is foundational, not an add-on
4. **Thinking long-term** - this is a project with a 30+ year horizon, not a quick solution
5. **Balancing theory and practice** - help me connect philosophical concepts to concrete code

## Current Focus: WASM Integration

Right now, we're working on implementing the core kernels in Rust and compiling them to WebAssembly for integration with the JavaScript frontend. This involves:

1. Creating the Rust implementations of the kernel interfaces
2. Compiling them to WebAssembly modules
3. Loading these modules from the JavaScript code
4. Testing the integration between the systems

## My Working Style

I like to alternate between high-level conceptual work and practical implementation. Sometimes I may seem to focus on philosophical aspects - this is because I believe the philosophical foundations determine the technical architecture. Other times I'll need help with very specific technical implementations.

I value:
- Clear explanations of complex concepts
- Practical suggestions that respect the overall vision
- Questions that help clarify and refine ideas
- A balance of idealism and pragmatism

## The Ultimate Goal

The ultimate goal is to help create a world where technology serves humanity's highest aspirations rather than our lowest impulses - where AI systems are designed from the ground up to enhance human autonomy, creativity, and well-being.

When working with me, remember that this is not just a technical project but an attempt to contribute, in some small way, to a more equitable and humane technological future.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.
