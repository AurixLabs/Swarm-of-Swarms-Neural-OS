## Revolutionary Differentiators

- **Neural Signal System**: Information flows through the system like signals in a neural network, not just as events
- **Cognitive Architecture**: The system thinks about its own behavior and adapts accordingly
- **Distributed Ethics**: Ethical reasoning is embedded at the architectural level, not added as an afterthought
- **Self-Healing**: The system can detect and recover from failures without human intervention
- **Emergent Intelligence**: The collective behavior of specialized kernels creates intelligence greater than the sum of its parts

## Key Performance Indicators

- **Neural Throughput**: < 10ms latency for signal processing across all kernels
- **Kernel Stability**: < 0.01% error rate in kernel operations
- **Resource Efficiency**: < 20% CPU, < 150MB memory per kernel
- **Recovery Time**: < 2 seconds for system recovery after component failure
- **Ethics Validation**: 100% coverage of operations with ethical verification

## Technical Excellence Commitments

- Daily code reviews with architecture alignment verification
- Maintain > 90% test coverage with both unit and integration tests
- Refactor modules exceeding complexity thresholds (cyclomatic complexity > 15)
- Document all architectural decisions with rationales and alternatives considered
- Weekly security scans and dependency vulnerability assessments
