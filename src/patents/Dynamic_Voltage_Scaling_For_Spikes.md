**Filing Date:** [Current Date]

## Abstract

A novel power management system for neuromorphic computing architectures that dynamically adjusts voltage and frequency based on spike activity patterns. The system enables unprecedented energy efficiency by allowing neuromorphic hardware to operate at minimum power levels during periods of low neural activity while maintaining full performance during high-activity computational phases.

## Background

Traditional computing systems implement dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) based on general processing loads, but these approaches are not optimized for the unique activity patterns of neuromorphic systems. Existing neuromorphic hardware typically operates at fixed power levels regardless of actual neural activity, leading to significant energy waste during sparse activation periods. Current approaches lack the fine-grained temporal responsiveness needed to match power consumption to the highly variable activity patterns characteristic of spiking neural networks.

## Summary of the Invention

The Dynamic Voltage Scaling for Spikes system implements a novel approach to neuromorphic power management through:

1. Real-time spike activity monitoring and prediction
2. Ultra-fast voltage/frequency adaptation for neuromorphic hardware
3. Region-specific power gating based on neural activation patterns
4. Optimized power state transitions minimizing overhead
5. Activity-aware scheduling of neural computations

The system enables neuromorphic processors to achieve maximum energy efficiency by closely matching power consumption to actual neural computational demands at millisecond timescales.
